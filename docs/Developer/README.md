## Running the simulation test-benches

First install verilator via the package manager. Specifically install `cmake`, `ninja` (aka `ninja-build`), `verilator` and `gtkwave`.

Each module has a `sim` directory in which there is a `build.sh`. Run this shell script to create the build. Then run the shell script `run.sh`. This runs the simulation executable and then opens the results for viewing in `gtkwave`.
